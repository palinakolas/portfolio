short_description: With My Halebop app, customers have a simple overview of mobile subscriptions and keep track of how much data they have left. The application gives access to invoices, payment information, support and at the same time creates a pleasing user experience through campaigns and offers.

## Process 
### 1. Research & Assumptions
During the research phase, it was important to step back and analyse the current approach to product development in the company. During previous years of app development, the marketing team was basically guessing what their users want and never tested neither their ideas nor results. Due to that, both iOS and Android apps have had low ratings and unsatisfied reviews.

In order to fix the current workflow, we decided to run this project using a Hypothesis-driven design process to show the marketing and development team how to get early feedback for their ideas.

In order to understand what problems exist in the current product, I have identified major pain points of customers through the analysis of customer support emails and app reviews. Major complaint was that customers didn't feel valued for being loyal.
Another way to get more assumptions of what our product needs, I gathered main stakeholders of the project and organised a brainstorming session where everyone shared their opinions. Then we wrote our assumptions and questions on sticky notes and organised them into groups to make it easier to review them.

### 2. Prioritize
When it comes to choosing which question to tackle first, I think about what would impact our product the most or what would bring the most value to our users.
As we had a big group of stakeholders, we dot-voted to prioritise the assumptions. 

### 3. Define hypotheses and develop experiment
After discussions and prioritisation, we had a clear question in mind.

Business POV - How can we extend the life of customers with Halebop through the app?
Customer POV - How might we show existing customers they are as valued as new customers? 

Based on these questions, the solutions can be:
1. Personalised Offers through notifications
2. “Die Donut Die” - Better visualisation of data usage
3. Chatbot integrated in apps and webpage.

Now we can combine the solution and question, and turn it into a hypothesis.

In other words, it’s crucial to have a measurable outcome for the hypothesis so we can determine whether it has succeeded or failed. A well-defined experiment can validate/invalidate the hypothesis.

Test card - Personalised offers
1. Hypothesis - We believe that personalised offers will make  our customers happy and willing to buy more “stuff” from us.
2. Test - To verify that, we will create a notification area that includes offers related to their current profile and usage.
3. Metric - And we will measure how many people access that area.
4. Criteria - We will be right if people take actions and get deals, or at least ask more about it.

Test card - Die Donut Die!
1. Hypothesis - We believe that customers need easy access to their usage.
2. Test - To verify that, we will create a visualisation of their usage and remaining data.
3. Metric - And we will measure if people have a clear interpretation of their usage and remaining data.
4. Criteria - We will be right if customer service has a lower number of issues regarding data usage.

Test Card - Halebot
1. Hypothesis - We believe that customers need accurate answers in an efficient manner.
2. Test - To verify that, we will create a chatbot (Halebot).
3. Metric - And we will measure errands solved and Customer effort score (CES).
4. Criteria - We will be right if the number of issues landing on agents are lower and CES is low.
					
### 4. Ideation & Prototype
After defining the experiment, we had the right base to start sketching and agree on a prototype to be tested with users. All we need is a low-fidelity prototype.

### 5. Test
Get REAL FEEDBACK and LEARN.
Put it in front of users, take notes and observe their reactions. Ask why! Make sure to ask open ended questions.
Insights, quotes, frictions, everything! There is no such a thing as a “stupid question”.		

Pre-interviews					
Mid-high-fidelity Prototype – Using the new Halebop assets, we put together an Invision clickable prototype, considering the assumptions we decided to test.	
						
Interview questions – We discussed what questions and how we could approach people, making sure to always ask open questions, to encourage people to be as honest and transparent as possible. 
						
Interviews - 5 people interviewed					
We got collection of insights, frictions and quotes			

### 6. Outcomes & Learnings					
Learning and synthesis from interviews					
– Group discussion: what have we heard, what surprised us, how did people react, what they expected etc.				
– Back in our groups, we summarised each interview. 
(User profile and insights x5)

Analysis					
– Once we analysed the users’ insights, we got back to our assumptions (test cards). Some of our assumptions were correct, and others needed iteration.
						
Learning Cards					
– What we learned, what we observed, decisions and actions we must take. 

Personalised deals
Hypothesis - We believed that personalised offers will make our customers happy and willing to buy more stuff from us.
Observation - We observed that people saw offers as “pushy” ads.
Learnings and insights - From that we learned that they need to be pleased at the right space, and communicated in a transparent and relevant manner, with the reason and the what is based on.
Decisions and actions: offer relevant,personalised suggestions, Concrete offers, Positioned in relevant areas, not only on the dashboard, Space where offers / deals live, Explore notifications.

Die donut die
Hypothesis - We believed that customers need easy access to an overview of their data usage.
Observation - We observed: balance is the main priority of the app; it’s clear how much I have left.
Learnings and insights - From that we learned that the breakdown of data usage is not a necessity, but nice to have
Decisions and actions: explore how to break down the data usage; focus on the data left.

Halebot
Hypothesis - We believed that customers need accurate answers in an efficient manner.
Observation - We observed they liked a direct connection with the company representative.
Learnings and insights - From that we learned that: direct is fast; they need visual queues. 
Decisions and actions: combine customer supportand chatbot, build a working prototype of chatbot,discover the fastest way of communication

#### MVP definition
We have all we need to decide what goes and what does not go in the Minimum viable product..
In the MVP we decided to focus on:
Focus on post paid and prepaid customers,
Core functionalities (login, account details, billing settings, app settings, switch between accounts)
Data usage visualisation
Chatbot and customer service
Not in the MVP:
Tailored and contextual suggestions
Data usage breakdown 

Draw “the onion” - how to bring the features to life


### 7. Further development
After MVP release of both IOS and Android, we had 3 channels that gathered user input: app reviews, customer support, and user tests.

More coming soon.
