short_description: With My Halebop app, customers have a simple overview of mobile
  subscriptions and keep track of how much data they have left. The application You
  can buy extra surf if it starts its and sometimes we hide easter eggs. Of course
  you get access to invoices, payment information, PUK codes, support, etc.

Business POV — How can we extend the life of customers with Halebop through the app?
Customer POV — How might we show existing customers they are as valued as new customers?

### Process

1\. Problem
SHARE IDEA/PROBLEM
Bring to the team a new idea/problem to be solved.
TEST CARD
Preparing ourselves: what are our assumptions? What are the questions that need to be answered?
SKETCHES
Everyone is sketching the app! At the end, we will define one main sketch.

2\. Prototype
PROTOTYPE
Refine main sketch and straight into prototype.
Medium fidelity is fine, but we will put it in front of users.

3\. Test
REAL FEEDBACK
Put it in front of users, take notes and observe their reactions. Ask why! Make sure to ask open ended questions.
LEARN
Insights, quotes, frictions, everything! There is no such a thing as a “stupid question”.

4\. Solution
MLP CANVAS
We have all we need to decide what goes and what does NOT go in the MLP.

And this is how we did it.

#### Day 1

Team breakfast - Check-in - Smileys - Ways of working - Project/team ceremonies Workshop 1 - Team availability - Project timeline/ milestones -Roles and responsibilities - The “onion”: how to bring the features to life

#### Day 2

Workshop 2 - hypothesis selection - test cards for assumptions - sketching session - low-fidelity prototype

#### Day 3

Pre-interviews - Medium-high fidelity prototype - Interview questions Interviews - 5 people interviewed - collection of insights, frictions and quotes

#### Day 4

Workshop 3 - Learnings from interviews - Synthesis of interviews - Analysis of insights - Learning cards and actions - MLP definition.

#### Day 1


Team breakfast
– Check-in
– Smileys :)
– Ways of working: we agreed on specific tools to better collaborate and bring the team together (Jira, Slack, Sketch, Trello, Invision).
– Project/team ceremonies: we defined the team will have stand-ups (daily), retros (2 weeks) and Halebop demo (monthly).

Day 1
Team Breakfast: outcomes
Tools
– Jira, for Project Development (Zlatan/Palina)
– Trello for Project tracking of progress (Marcio/Valentin) – Slack for day-to-day communications (Sebastian)
– Sketch for UI/UX Design
– Invision/Craft for sharing design updates (Sebastian)
Meetings and Ceremonies
– Daily: stand-up at 9.15am (Sweden time) – Every 2 weeks: team retro/review
– Once a month: Halebop team update

Day 1
Workshop 1
Team availability
Project timeline/milestones
Roles and responsibilities
The “onion”: how to bring the features to life

Day 1
Workshop 1: outcomes
Timelines
– New Product Portfolio: end of March 2018
– App pre-launch: 1st of March 2018
– App testing period: throughout March 2018, so it's ok by New Product Portfolio release.
– To be done: visualise team dedication/availability plan, organise timeline with features/themes week-by-week displaying outcomes.
Risks:
– Halebop has 3 Developers that will focus on the app.
– Website, GDPR, New Portfolio and other projects are in the pipeline.
– These other priorities are not clear yet, but will certainly affect the app design and development.
– Resources will have to be relocated to different projects, unless the business decides to hire people.
– Reducing resources will delay the app development.

Day 1
Workshop 1: outcomes
Roles & Responsibilities
– Business Owner: Adam
– Product Owner: Zlatan
– Process Lead: Marcio
– Design: Valentin (UX/UI), Sebastian (UX/UI), Mia (UI, Branding), Palina (UX)
– Development: Niklas Li. (Back-end), Niklas Le. (iOS), Palina (Front-end), Android Dev?
– Other Stakeholders: Johanna will be our bridge to them :)

Day 1
Workshop 1: outcomes
The “onion”: how to bring the features to life
– Going back to our “onion map”, sketching ideas on how those features (personalised deals, support, notifications) can be visualised through the app.

#### 
Day 2


Workshop 2
hypothesis selection
test cards for assumptions
sketching session low-fidelity prototype

Workshop 2: outcomes
Hypothesis selection and Test Cards
– After analysing and discussions our sketches and visualisations, the team narrowed down to there hypothesis. We then created our Test Cards.
1\.Personalised Offers (through notifications)
2\.“Die Donut Die”
3\.Halebot !

Test card - Personalised offers
1\. Hypothesis - We believe that personalised offers will make  our customers happy and willing to buy more “stuff” from us.
2\. Test - To verify that, we will create a notification area that includes offers related to their current profile and usage.
3\. Metric - And we will measure how many people access that area.
4\. Criteria - We will be right if people take actions and get deals, or at least ask more about it.

Test card - Die Donut Die!
1\. Hypothesis - We believe that customers need easy access to their usage.
2\. Test - To verify that, we will create a visualisation of their usage and remaining data.
3\. Metric - And we will measure if people have a clear interpretation of their usage and remaining data.
4\. Criteria - We will be right if customer service has lower number of issues regards to data usage.

Test Card - Halebot
1\. Hypothesis - We believe that customers need accurate answers in the efficient manner.
2\. Test - To verify that, we will create a chatbot (Halebot).
3\. Metric - And we will measure errands solved and Customer effort score (CES).
4\. Criteria - We will be right if number of issues landing on agents are lower and CES is low.

Workshop 2: outcomes					
Low-fidelity Prototype

Once the Test Cards and the assumptions were defined, we had the right content to sketch and agree on a low-fidelity prototype to be tested with users.

#### Day 3

Pre-interviews
Medium-high fidelity prototype
Interview questions

Interviews						
5 people interviewed
collection of insights, frictions and quotes

Pre-interviews

Mid-high-fidelity Prototype			
– Using the new Halebop assets, we put together an Invision clickable prototype, considering the assumptions we decided to test.

Interview questions

– We discussed what questions and how we could approach people, making sure to always ask open questions, to encourage people to be as honest and transparent as possible.

Interviews						
5 people interviewed					
collection of insights, frictions and quotes			
–  The team split in 2 groups
–  We offered Cinema tickets to our interviewees.
–  Not easy to get people to agree in talking to us!
–  Next time: maybe we should be wearing Halebop/Telia shirts or jumpers? Brand credibility might be the key!

#### Day 4

Workshop 3
Learnings and synthesis from interviews
Analysis of insights
Learning cards and actions
MLP definition.

Workshop 3: outcomes

Learning and synthesis from interviews					
– Group discussion: what have we heard, what surprised us, how did people react, what they expected etc.				
– Back in our groups, we summarised each interview.
(User profile and insights x5)

Analysis					
– Once we analysed the users’ insights, we got back to our assumptions (test cards). Some of our assumptions were correct, and others needed iteration.

Learning Cards					
– What we learned, what we observed, decisions and actions we must take.

Personalised deals Hypothesis - We believe that personalised offers will make our customers happy and willing to buy more stuff from us. Observation - We observed that people saw offers as “pushy” ads. Learnings and insights - From that we learned that they need to be pleased at the right space, and communicated in a transparent and relevant manner, with the reason and the what is based on. Decisions and actions offer relevant suggestions, personalised Concrete offers Positioned in relevant areas, not only on the dashboard Space where offers / deals live Explore notifications.
